# Comprehensive Analysis of Promising Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration Technologies

## Overview of Current DAC and Carbon Sequestration Technologies

Direct air capture (DAC) technologies involve the physical removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, followed by either storage or utilization. Concurrently, various carbon sequestration methods focus on storing captured CO2 in geological formations, mineralized forms, or utilizing it in other industrial processes.

### DAC Technologies Overview
1. **Post-combustion Capture with Absorption**
   - Utilizes solvents to absorb CO₂ from ambient air.

   - Offers a permanent storage solution with minimal risk of leakage.

3. **Ionic Liquid-Based Absorption**
   - Uses ionic liquids that can capture CO₂ at lower concentrations than traditional solvents.
   - Exhibits higher thermal stability and recyclability compared to organic solvents.

4. **Membrane Separation Processes**
   - Relies on selective membranes to extract CO₂ from air.
   - Offers energy efficiency advantages over absorption methods.

5. **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)**
