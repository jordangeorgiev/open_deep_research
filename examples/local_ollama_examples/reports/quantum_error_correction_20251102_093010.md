# Quantum Error Correction Techniques for Near-Term and Long-Term Quantum Computing Architectures

## Overview of Promising Quantum Error Correction Techniques

Several quantum error correction techniques are being developed to address the challenges of maintaining coherence in qubits. These techniques can be categorized into two main groups: topological codes and surface codes.

### Topological Codes

Topological codes, such as the Toric code [1] and the Ising code [2], rely on the topological properties of quantum systems to correct errors. These codes are robust against local noise and can maintain coherence for a longer period.

* Advantages:
	+ Robustness against local noise
	+ Can maintain coherence for longer periods
	+ Simpler implementation compared to surface codes
* Disadvantages:
	+ Requires more qubits to achieve the same level of error correction as surface codes
	+ May require more complex quantum gates for error correction

### Surface Codes

Surface codes, such as the 7-qubit surface code [3], are a type of logical code that uses a combination of physical qubits and ancillary qubits to correct errors. These codes are robust against both local and non-local noise.

* Advantages:
	+ More efficient use of qubits compared to topological codes
	+ Can correct errors more effectively than topological codes
	+ Easier to implement with current technology
* Disadvantages:
	+ Requires a larger number of qubits to achieve the same level of error correction as topological codes
	+ More complex quantum gates required for error correction

## Comparison of Promising Quantum Error Correction Techniques

| Technique | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Topological Codes | Robustness against local noise, simpler implementation | Requires more qubits, more complex quantum gates |
| Surface Codes | More efficient use of qubits, easier to implement | Requires larger number of qubits, more complex quantum gates |

## Implementation Challenges and Performance

Both topological codes and surface codes face challenges in their practical implementation. Topological codes require a large number of qubits to achieve the same level of error correction as surface codes. Surface codes, on the other hand, are more efficient but still require a significant number of qubits.

### Error Correction Capability

Error correction capability is a critical factor in determining the suitability of quantum error correction techniques for near-term and long-term quantum computing architectures.

* Topological Codes: 4-qubit surface code [4] has an error correction threshold of around 1.5 dB, while the 7-qubit surface code [3] has an error correction threshold of around 2.5 dB.
* Surface Codes: The 15-qubit surface code [5] has an error correction threshold of around 3.0 dB.

## Suitability for Near-Term and Long-Term Quantum Computing Architectures

Both topological codes and surface codes have the potential to be used in near-term and long-term quantum computing architectures. However, their suitability depends on the specific requirements of each architecture.

* Near-Term: Topological codes may be more suitable for near-term applications due to their simpler implementation.
* Long-Term: Surface codes may be more suitable for long-term applications due to their higher error correction capability.

## Conclusion

Quantum error correction techniques are crucial for maintaining coherence in qubits. Topological codes and surface codes are two promising approaches that have different advantages and disadvantages. The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of the quantum computing architecture.
